# largest-triangle-three-buckets_2D
Use largest-triangle-three-buckets to downsampling 2D trajectory map

Through my tests, largest-triangle-three-buckets can fastly downsample any 2D trajectory maps.

For simply use, just install gnuplot and run "./run.sh" in command line.

Furthermore, you can change parameters at line 12 of "main.py" and line 6&11 of "generator.py".
Remember to save files after changing patameters, then run "./run.sh" again to see changes.
